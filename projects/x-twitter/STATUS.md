- Cookies extracted via CDP from clawd browser
- Config at ~/.config/bird/config.json5
- Instagram logged back in ✅
- TikTok needs password recovery (different credentials)

- Phone on account ends in 98

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Configure bird CLI for programmatic posting
2. [ ] Post more content (HellFold teasers, behind-the-scenes)
3. [ ] Engage with audio plugin community
4. [ ] Build follower base
5. [ ] Cross-post content to Instagram/TikTok

## Notes
- X has "graduated access" for new accounts — posts may go through review
- Don't trigger password resets without Jess's permission
- Browser file upload works with `selector` approach, not `ref`
