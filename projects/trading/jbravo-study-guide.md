## 🎯 THE BRAVO METHOD — Core Trading Strategy

### Primary Entry/Exit System (The Foundation)

This is the heart of J Bravo's "Dominate Stocks" approach, confirmed by multiple sources including fan-made TradingView indicators:

| Signal | Condition | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **BUY** | Full price bar closes **ABOVE** SMA 9 | Enter long position |
| **SELL** | Price bar closes **BELOW** EMA 20 | Exit position |
| **STRONG BUY** | All MAs sloping UP, aligned: 9 → 20 → 180 (top to bottom) | High-confidence entry |
| **STRONG SELL** | All MAs sloping DOWN, aligned: 180 → 20 → 9 (top to bottom) | Strong exit/short signal |

### Key Moving Averages
1. **SMA 9** (Simple Moving Average, 9 periods) — Primary entry trigger
2. **EMA 20** (Exponential Moving Average, 20 periods) — Primary exit trigger  
3. **SMA/EMA 180** — Long-term trend direction (alignment check)
4. **200 Day MA** — "The Important Little White Line" — Major trend filter

### "GoGo Juice" — VWAP Confirmation Layer
J Bravo calls VWAP his "GoGo Juice" — a confirmation signal on top of the MA system:
- **GoGo Long**: VWAP crosses ABOVE EMA 20 → confirms bullish momentum
- **GoGo Short**: VWAP crosses BELOW EMA 20 → confirms bearish momentum

### Full Body Candle Close Rule
- Don't act on wicks — wait for the **full candle body** to close above/below the MA
- This filters out false breakouts and noise
- Applies to all timeframes

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Teachable is OFFLINE** — His j-bravo.teachable.com school is no longer active
2. **linktojbravo.com** — This appears to be a suspicious investment platform claiming 1-2% daily returns. Likely NOT his real site or a scam using his name. DO NOT send money.
3. **Content Pivot** — His YouTube channel has completely pivoted to silver/gold commentary (doom/clickbait style). The actual trading education is in his PAID courses, not recent free YouTube content.
4. **Course Value** — The Dominate Stocks course curriculum is actually solid and well-structured. The indicators and strategy are legitimate technical analysis approaches.
5. **Best for Bull Markets** — His primary strategy (Dominate Stocks) is optimized for bull/uptrending markets. The Bear Market Money course covers the downside.

## 📝 Summary: The J Bravo System in One Sentence

> **Buy when the full candle closes above SMA(9), sell when it closes below EMA(20), only trade in the direction of the trend confirmed by MA alignment (9>20>180) and the 200 DMA, with VWAP as "GoGo Juice" confirmation.**

This is a **trend-following swing trading system** with multiple confirmation layers. It's designed to catch medium-term moves (days to weeks) with clear, rules-based entry and exit criteria — making it highly suitable for automation.
