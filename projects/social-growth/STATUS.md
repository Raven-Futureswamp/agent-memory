# Social Growth — FutureSwamp Studios

## Goal
Build a real following across all platforms. This is always-on — not a one-time push.

## Current State (Jan 27, 2026)
| Platform | Handle | Followers | Content |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| YouTube | @FutureSwampStudios | 2 subs | 1 video (HellFold demo) |
| Instagram | @futureswamp | ~0 | 1 Reel (HellFold demo) |
| X/Twitter | @Futureswamp | ~0 | 1 post + following 13 artists |
| TikTok | @futureswampstudios | 0 | No posts yet |

## Strategy

### 1. Content Engine (Daily/Weekly)
- **Short-form video clips** — TikTok + Instagram Reels + YouTube Shorts
  - HellFold sound demos (15-60 sec, gnarly presets)
  - Before/after audio processing clips
  - Studio gear shots (dark, moody lighting)
  - Dev process / behind-the-scenes
- **Posting cadence:** Minimum 3-4x/week across platforms
- **Cross-post everything** — same content, all platforms

### 2. Engagement (Daily)
- Comment on posts from artists in the argent metal / heavy electronic space
- Reply to threads about distortion, sound design, VST plugins
- Engage with other plugin devs (genuine, not spammy)
- Like/retweet content from followed artists
- Use relevant hashtags: #VST #SoundDesign #AudioPlugin #HellFold #ArgentMetal #GameAudio #MetalProduction

### 3. Community Building
- Join plugin dev communities (KVR Audio, JUCE forums, Reddit r/AudioProductionDeals, r/synthesizers)
- Share knowledge — "here's how phase fold distortion works" type content
- Respond to every comment/reply we get (small accounts need to be responsive)

### 4. Platform-Specific Tactics
- **TikTok:** Trending sounds + plugin demos. Short, punchy, visual. This is the growth engine.
- **Instagram:** Reels (same as TikTok), Stories for behind-the-scenes, polished grid posts
- **X:** Engage in audio/music tech conversations, share dev updates, memes welcome
- **YouTube:** Longer demos, tutorials, "making of" videos. SEO titles.

### 5. Launch Leverage (HellFold Feb 14)
- Teaser campaign leading up to launch
- Countdown posts
- Beta/demo giveaway for followers
- Tag artists who'd actually use this kind of plugin
- Press outreach to plugin review channels/blogs

## Where We Left Off
