## Lessons Learned
1. **Write things down immediately** — conversation history can be lost
2. **Memory files persist, chat history doesn't**
3. Contact cards don't come through as text — ask for typed numbers
4. Toggle iMessage off/on to force re-registration with Apple
5. **For projects: create dedicated notes** — don't rely on chat history
