# HellFold Product Knowledge

## Quick Pitch
Phase distortion engine with 15 algorithms. Not a typical distortion — manipulates timing relationships (phase), not just amplitude. Creates harmonic complexity and movement that sounds fundamentally different from any amp sim or saturation plugin.

## Key Differentiators
- **Phase Fold** — unique phase-based distortion (not amplitude clipping/saturation)
- **Oct Fold** — YIN pitch detection for organic sub-octave generation (before distortion stage)
- **15 algorithms** — each with unique Drive + Control 2 behavior
- **Dual EQ** — 3-band parametric (pre/post routing!) + 5-band graphic
- **Audio-reactive visuals** — fire, lightning, circuits, skull (OpenGL)
- **A/B comparison** built in
- **66 factory presets**
- **8x oversampling**

## Algorithm Cheat Sheet
| Algorithm | Character | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Velvet Fold | Smooth warm saturation | Vocals, acoustic, master bus |
| Shatter Fold | Aggressive glitchy breakup | Industrial drums, synths |
| Mirror Fold | Bell-like harmonics | Synth leads, bass |
| Digital Decimation | Lo-fi bitcrusher | Lo-fi beats, chiptune |
| Thermal Warp | Tube overdrive | Guitar, bass, vocals |
| Cascade Fold | Multi-stage dense harmonics | Sound design, metalcore |
| Tape Saturation | Analog warmth | Full mixes, drums |
| Pressure Warp | Punchy compressed drive | Drums, aggressive vocals |
| Clipped Fold | Hard clip + wavefold | Metal guitars |
| Shadow Bend | Asymmetric even harmonics | Bass guitar, body |
| Harmonic Twist | Odd/even control | Tone shaping, amps |
| Half-Wave Collapse | Rectified buzzy | Bass drops, industrial |
| Skewed Reality | Otherworldly dissonant | Horror, experimental |
| Transformer Saturation | Iron core weight | Drums, mastering |
| Vowel Filter | Formant morphing | EDM bass, vocal FX |
