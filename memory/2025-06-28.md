## Lessons Learned
- **WRITE THINGS DOWN IMMEDIATELY** — context compaction wiped our session mid-setup
- Always log passwords/credentials location before moving on
- Memory files survive compaction; conversation history doesn't
- Can't send SMS (no phone number on Apple ID) — only iMessage
- Contact cards don't come through as text — ask for number to be typed
