# 2026-01-25 — Major Trading Infrastructure Day

## Kalshi Prediction Markets
- **Account:** $100 capital, API connected, live trading
- **Current cash:** ~$64.58 (selling Trump/Fed position)
- **Positions:** DOGE cuts >$250B (25 NO @ 77¢), DOGE cuts $1T (1 NO @ 88¢)
- **Selling:** Trump ends Fed (21 NO @ 92¢) — 5/21 filled at 90¢, 16 resting. Grok said 2029 is too long for $100 capital. Small loss (~$0.42) to free up ~$19.
- **Rule change:** No positions resolving beyond 12 months

### Kalshi Auto-Trader Built (Level 2 Semi-Auto)
- `scripts/kalshi/auto_trader.py` — runs hourly via cron
- Cross-references 4 sources: Kalshi, Polymarket, PredictIt, The Odds API
- FRED economic data integrated (Fed rate, CPI, unemployment)
- Strict keyword matching (no fuzzy — caused junk before)
- Auto-executes trades passing risk rules, alerts Jess via iMessage

### Grok v2 Upgrades (sub-agent built)
- 100+ keyword match rules (was ~30): CPI ranges, Fed rate, GDP, NFL/NBA teams, weather
- CPI probability model from FRED historical data — found 14 opportunities (was 2)
- Smaller bets: $10 per trade (10%) instead of $20 (20%), max 6 positions
- Stop-loss (-15%) and take-profit (+20%) on prediction market positions
- Catalyst calendar (FOMC, CPI release, jobs report dates)
- Sports odds: converts American odds to probability, compares vs Kalshi

### Bug Found & Fixed
- Kalshi Python SDK v2.1.4 changed API — order placement was failing silently
- Fixed in trade.py and auto_trader.py — use kwargs not CreateOrderRequest object

## Alpaca Stock Trading
- **Account:** $100 cash, LIVE, API connected
- **Status:** Auto-trader built, market closed (opens Monday 8:30 AM CST)

### Alpaca Auto-Trader Built (Level 2, Grok-Optimized)
- `scripts/trading/alpaca_trader.py` — runs every 30 min during market hours via cron
- Watchlist: NVDA, TSLA, AMD, META, PLTR, AAPL, MSFT + SPY, QQQ
- Grok's 8 recommendations implemented:
  1. Momentum threshold: 2% (was 3%)
  2. Stop loss: -2% (was -3%)
  3. Trailing stop: 2.5% (replaces fixed +6% take profit)
  4. VWAP filter (only buy above VWAP)
  5. Watchlist: dropped SOFI, added AAPL + MSFT
  6. Bracket orders (auto stop loss at entry)
  7. Swing trading 1-3 day holds (not day trading)
  8. Cash buffer $10, max position 45%

## API Keys Added
- **FRED_API_KEY** — Fed economic data (free)
- **ODDS_API_KEY** — Sports betting odds from DraftKings/FanDuel etc (free 500/mo)
- Both in `.env`

## NFL Conference Championships
- **NFC:** Seahawks 31, Rams 27 (Q4, Seahawks likely won)
- **AFC:** Patriots 10, Broncos 7 (Final)
- **Likely Super Bowl:** Seahawks vs Patriots
- Seattle Super Bowl winner market on Kalshi: YES 64-66¢ (13.5M volume)
- Jess decided not to bet on it, saving cash for data-driven plays

## Cron Jobs Running
- `kalshi-auto-trader` — every hour, scans + auto-trades
- `alpaca-auto-trader` — every 30 min during market hours
- `email-check` — every 15 min

## Project Files
- `projects/kalshi-trading.md` — full Kalshi trading docs
- `projects/trading-system.md` — Alpaca stock trading docs
- `projects/trading-fund.md` — overall fund overview ($200 total: $100 Kalshi + $100 Alpaca)

## Key Decisions
- Jess chose Level 2 (semi-auto) for both platforms — auto-execute within rules, alert on every trade
- Using Grok (xAI) as strategy advisor — good results, specific and actionable
- Focus on short-term, data-driven markets over long-term political bets
- $200 total capital split evenly between Kalshi and Alpaca

## Kalshi Auto-Trader — Fixed & Running
- **Bug:** Pydantic validation error from Kalshi SDK v2.1.4 API change
- **Fix:** Changed `create_order(create_order_request=order)` → `create_order(**order.model_dump(exclude_none=True))` in both `trade.py` and `auto_trader.py`

  1. Unemployment > 4.5%: 50 YES @ 17¢ ($8.50) — 488% ROI, 11 days
