# 2026-01-25 - Email Setup Day

## What We Did
- Set up email access for Raven
- Tried Outlook/Hotmail first but Microsoft has deprecated basic auth for IMAP (even with app passwords)
- Created new Gmail account that works with himalaya CLI

## Email Configuration
- **Gmail:** ravenfutureswamp2026@gmail.com
- **App password:** stored in macOS Keychain under "himalaya-gmail"
- **Config:** ~/.config/himalaya/config.toml
- **CLI:** `himalaya` commands work for reading/sending

## Also Set Up
- raven@futureswamp.com → forwards to futureswamp@hotmail.com (via Porkbun)
- jeshua@futureswamp.com → same forward
- 2FA enabled on Hotmail account (recovery code saved by Jess)

## Browser Relay
- Chrome extension installed at ~/.clawdbot/browser/chrome-extension
- Works but Google signup pages block automation (needed Jess's help with captchas)

## Notes
- Microsoft Outlook personal accounts no longer support basic auth for IMAP
- Gmail still works with app passwords
- himalaya CLI is solid for email management
