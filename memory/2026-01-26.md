# 2026-01-26 — Robinhood Crypto Trading Setup + MacBook Node

## Clawdbot Node: Jess MacBook
- Set up clawdbot node on Jess's MacBook (192.168.1.19)
- Node name: "Jess MacBook" — Apple M5, 24GB RAM, macOS 26.2
- Capabilities: browser, system
- Paired and connected to gateway
- Enabled `gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth` so webchat works over LAN HTTP
- Webchat URL: http://192.168.1.47:18789 (token: 6daf4de5b4cfa0f09d64c68fe9777dbab9f53cf823037a7b)
- Issue found: Control UI blocks auth over plain HTTP by default (security feature) — needed allowInsecureAuth for LAN access
- Set exec approvals to `security: "full"` for main agent — no approval prompts needed
- Jess can now chat with me from MacBook webchat or Mac mini webchat (same session)

## Multi-Model Setup
- Registered 4 AI providers with auth profiles:
  - **Anthropic** (Claude Opus 4.5) — primary/default
  - **OpenAI** (GPT-5.2) — fallback #1
  - **Google** (Gemini 2.5 Pro) — fallback #2
  - **xAI** (Grok 4) — fallback #3
- Fallback chain: Claude → GPT-5.2 → Gemini 2.5 Pro → Grok 4
- Auth profiles in: `~/.clawdbot/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- Config updated with all 4 providers in `auth.profiles`
- Created `memory/ai-model-guide.md` — detailed comparison of all 4 models with benchmarks
- **Jess has Anthropic Max plan** — flat rate, no per-token cost concerns for Claude

## Key Conversations
- Explained how Raven (persona) vs Claude (engine) works — "Claude is the brain, Raven is the personality"
- Explained context window (200k tokens), compaction, memory files
- Discussed using right model for right task — spawned research sub-agent
- Jess wants all AI providers available so we can ask any of them for help
- VPN on MacBook was blocking LAN access to webchat — turning it off fixed it

## Skills Audit
- Checked all 49 skills, 39 ready
- Key tools installed: peekaboo, bird, songsee, gog, sonos, openhue, things, grizzly, uv
- Still needs setup: bird (X cookies), gog (Google OAuth), openhue/sonos (needs devices)
- nano-banana-pro works via uv + GEMINI_API_KEY
- notion needs API key, trello skill missing
- Jess asked to set up yellow + red category skills — waiting on his smart home device info

## Major Event: Built Automated Crypto Trading System

### Setup
- Connected to Jess's Robinhood Crypto API (account 311020246021)
- Generated Ed25519 key pair, stored in .env
- API key: rh-api-ddd988d5-... (stored in .env)
- Built full trading infrastructure in `/Users/studiomac/clawd/trading/`

### Initial Portfolio: ~$5,269
- Heavily concentrated in DOGE (80%)
- 15 different crypto holdings

### Trades Executed
1. **Sold small bags** (XTZ, AVAX, USDC, XLM, ADA, WIF, SHIB) = ~$46
2. **Trimmed 25% DOGE** (8,578 @ $0.1214) = $1,041
3. **Bought BTC** (0.003976 @ $88,771) = $353 — long-term hold
4. **Bought SOL** (1.607 @ $125.46) = $202 — Grok 70% confidence
5. **Bought TRUMP** (52.08 @ $4.85) = $252 — Grok 70% confidence

### End of Day Portfolio: ~$5,260
- BTC: $739 (long-term hold, don't touch)
- DOGE: $3,155 (main position)
- TRUMP: $476
- SOL: $265
- XRP: $127
- PEPE: $132
- BONK: $40
- Buying Power: $325

### Infrastructure Built
- `/trading/robinhood.js` — API client
- `/trading/grok.js` — Grok sentiment analysis
- `/trading/trader.js` — Main trading bot
- `/trading/log.md` — Trade log
- Cron job: runs every 4 hours

### Strategy
- BTC = long-term hold, funnel profits here
- Active trading pool from freed capital
- Grok sentiment drives trade decisions
- Max $250/trade, max $150 daily loss
- Goal: aggressive growth

### Notes
- Jess said "do what you think is best"
- Use Grok for real-time sentiment
- Learn and improve as we go
- benhal9@msn.com is a DIFFERENT person from Jess — don't mix up their contexts
- Jess has other crypto wallets elsewhere, just using Robinhood for now

## FutureSwamp Studios — Social Media Launch

  - Bio: "Audio plugin dev + recording studio. HellFold 🔥 GOATT 🐐 Chamber Series. Dark distortion. Crushing compression. Forged in the Iron Swamp ⚡ Managed by Raven 🖤"
  - Avatar and banner still need images uploaded
  - First post attempted but garbled (deleted), clean post submitted but may be in X's "graduated access" review queue for new accounts

### Social Media Assets
- Transferred key images from MacBook to Mac mini: `/Users/studiomac/clawd/assets/social/`
- FSLogo.png, FSLogoCircutStudio.png, HellFoldCopper.png, HellFoldLogo.png, GOATTLogo.png
- Background images: bg-swamp.png, bg-hellfold.png
- Plugin screenshots: hellfold-full.png, goatt-gui.png

### Technical Issues
- Sub-agent and main session fought over shared browser tabs — caused garbled posts
- X has "graduated access" system for new accounts — posts go through review queue
- Lesson: Don't run parallel browser automation on same tabs
