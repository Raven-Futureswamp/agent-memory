### Trades — 2026-01-27

| Time | Symbol | Side | Qty | Price | Value | Reasoning |
|------|--------|------|-----|-------|-------|-----------|
| 04:00 UTC (10:00 PM CST) | TRUMP-USD | BUY | 52.1089 | $4.80 | $250.00 | Bot sentiment +45 (political buzz, meme coin hype). Note: Grok recommended SELL (sentiment -20) but bot's internal model overrode. Support at $4.50, resistance at $5.20. |

**Grok Overall Sentiment:** 30 (cautious)
**Macro:** Fed rate decisions, CPI data, BTC ETF inflows, regulatory scrutiny.

**Post-Trade Portfolio:**
- BTC: 0.00839 (~$744) — LONG TERM HOLD
- DOGE: 25,736 (~$3,157) — main position
- TRUMP: 150.41 (~$722) — ⚠️ now 2nd largest position
- SOL: 2.113 (~$263)
- PEPE: 26.5M (~$135)
- XRP: 66.82 (~$127)
- BONK: 4.66M (~$41)
- **Buying Power: ~$75**
- **Total Portfolio: ~$5,263**

**⚠️ Note:** TRUMP is now a significant position ($722). Grok flagged bearish outlook with 10-20% downside risk. Buying power is low (~$75). Monitor closely.
| 08:01 UTC (2:01 AM CST) | SOL-USD | BUY | 0.4019 | $124.39 | $50.00 | Grok sentiment +60: Solana ecosystem growth, DeFi partnerships, network upgrades. Momentum upward above $110 support. |
| 08:01 UTC (2:01 AM CST) | BTC-USD | BUY | 0.000826 | $88,210 | $72.94 | ❌ FAILED — insufficient buying power (SOL buy consumed remaining funds). Grok sentiment +50. |

**Grok Overall Sentiment:** 40 (cautious-neutral)
**Macro:** Fed rate decisions, inflation reports, BTC ETF inflows, SEC regulatory developments.

**Post-Trade Portfolio (2:01 AM CST):**
- BTC: 0.00839 (~$740) — LONG TERM HOLD
- DOGE: 25,736 (~$3,141) — main position
- TRUMP: 150.41 (~$717) — ⚠️ 2nd largest, monitor
- SOL: 2.514 (~$313) — added 0.4019
- PEPE: 26.5M (~$133)
- XRP: 66.82 (~$127)
- BONK: 4.66M (~$41)
- **Buying Power: ~$23**
- **Total Portfolio: ~$5,233**

**⚠️ Notes:** Buying power critically low (~$23). No sells recommended by Grok this cycle. TRUMP exposure remains elevated. Next run may need to consider rebalancing if buying power stays depleted.
| 12:02 UTC (6:02 AM CST) | SOL-USD | BUY | 0.1813 | ~$124 | $22.48 | ❌ FAILED — insufficient buying power. Grok sentiment +30 (ecosystem upgrades, DeFi activity). |
| 12:02 UTC (6:02 AM CST) | BTC-USD | BUY | 0.000255 | ~$87,898 | $22.48 | ❌ FAILED — insufficient buying power. Grok sentiment +40 (ETF inflows, institutional adoption). |
| 12:02 UTC (6:02 AM CST) | TRUMP-USD | BUY | 4.2099 | $4.75 | ~$20 | ✅ Executed. Bot sentiment +40 (political buzz, meme hype). Note: Grok recommended SELL (sentiment -10, 10-20% downside risk) but bot overrode again. |

**Grok Overall Sentiment:** 15 (cautious)
**Macro:** US election volatility, potential Fed rate cuts, Bitcoin ETF flows, CPI data.

**Post-Trade Portfolio (6:02 AM CST):**
- BTC: 0.00839 (~$737) — LONG TERM HOLD
- DOGE: 25,736 (~$3,147) — main position
- TRUMP: 154.62 (~$734) — ⚠️⚠️ NOW LARGEST AFTER DOGE. Bot keeps buying against Grok SELL signals.
- SOL: 2.514 (~$312)
- PEPE: 26.5M (~$131)
- XRP: 66.82 (~$126)
- BONK: 4.66M (~$40)
- **Buying Power: ~$2** (effectively depleted)
- **Total Portfolio: ~$5,231**

**⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES:**
1. **Buying power is GONE.** No more buys possible without selling.
2. **TRUMP exposure is dangerously high** — $734 (14% of portfolio) and growing. Bot has bought TRUMP 3 times in 24h despite Grok flagging SELL twice. The bot's internal model keeps overriding Grok's bearish sentiment.
3. **Bot behavior concern:** The trader is consistently overriding Grok's SELL signals on TRUMP. This is the opposite of the intended strategy. May need code review.
4. **No sells executed** — the bot hasn't sold anything since inception despite negative sentiment signals.
